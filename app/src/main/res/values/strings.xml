    <string name="lorem">Youve probably heard of Lorem Ipsum before â€“ its the most-used dummy text excerpt out there. People use it because it has a fairly normal distribution of letters and words (making it look like normal English), but its also Latin, which means your average reader wont get distracted by trying to read it.
